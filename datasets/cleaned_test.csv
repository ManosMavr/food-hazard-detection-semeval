2000,8,19,us,california grocery recalls ground beef products for possible e. colio157:h7 contamination,"washington, aug.
      14, 2000--bel-air supermarket, a retail store at 1286 stabler lane, yuba
      city, calif., is voluntarily recalling approximately 400 pounds of ground
      beef products that may be contaminated with e. coli o157:h7, the
      u.s. department of agricultures food safety and inspection service
      announced today.
      the ground beef
      products were produced on aug. 8 and packaged in various sizes. the
      packages are labeled ""porters ground beef not to exceed 20%
      fat,"" with a ""sell by"" date of 08/09/00; ""ground round
      not to exceed 15% fat,"" with a ""sell by"" date of 08/10/00;
      and ""cert. angus beef, ground round, not to excd 15% fat,"" with
      a ""sell by"" date of 08/10/00.
      ""because of
      the potential hazard of foodborne illness from consumption of meat
      products contaminated with harmful pathogens, we urge consumers who have
      purchased the suspect product not to eat it and return it to the place of
      purchase,"" said thomas j. billy, fsis administrator. ""this is an
      opportunity to remind consumers to always follow the safe handling
      instructions required on all raw meat and poultry products and cook ground
      beef to an internal temperature of 160 degrees f.""
      the problem was
      discovered through routine fsis microbiological sampling.
      
      e. coli
      o157:h7 is a potentially deadly pathogen that can cause bloody diarrhea
      and dehydration. the very young, the elderly, and persons with compromised
      immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness.
      fsis has received
      no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of this product.
      anyone concerned about an illness should contact a physician.
      consumers and
      media with questions about the recall may contact carolyn white,
      communications manager, bel-air supermarket, at 1-800-725-3977, ext. 6211.
      consumers with
      food safety questions can phone the toll-free usda meat and poultry
      hotline at 1-800-535-4555. the hotline can be reached from 10 a.m. to 4
      p.m. (eastern time) monday through friday, and recorded food safety
      messages are available 24 hours a day.

      note: access news releases and other
      information at the fsis web site at http://www.fsis.usda.gov. 
    preparing ground beef
    for safe consumption
    consumers should only eat ground beef
    patties that have been cooked to a safe temperature of 160 f. when a ground beef patty
    is cooked to 
    160 f throughout, it can be safe and
    juicy, regardless of color. 
    the only way to be sure a ground beef patty
    is cooked to a high enough temperature to kill harmful bacteria is to use an accurate
    digital instant-read thermometer.
    color is not a reliable indicator that
    ground beef patties have been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria
    such as e. coli o157:h7. 
    eating a pink or red ground beef patty
    without first verifying that the safe temperature of 160 f has been reached is a
    significant risk factor for foodborne illness. 
    thermometer use to ensure proper cooking
    temperature is especially important for those who cook or serve ground beef patties to
    people most at risk for foodborne illness because e. coli o157:h7 can lead to
    serious illness or even death. those most at risk include young children, the elderly, and
    those with compromised immune systems."

pca is immediately stopping all production at the blakely, georgia facility and notifying its customers to recall and retain all affected product produced during these dates at this plant.
""we deeply regret that this product recall is expanding and our first priority is to protect the health of our customers. our company has worked around the clock for the last week with federal regulators to help identify any potential problems. our blakely facility is currently not operating as we continue to work with federal food safety investigators,""parnell said.

2009,5,31,us,2007 - pa department of health warns consumers of tainted raw milk sold by york county dairy,"for immediate release -- harrisburg, pa -- march 2, 2007 -- state health secretary dr. calvin b. johnson today advised consumers who purchased raw milk from stump acres dairy of new salem, york county, to immediately discard the raw milk due to the risk of contamination with salmonella.
raw milk is milk that has not been pasteurized or homogenized.
“we are working very closely with the pennsylvania department of agriculture to conduct local public health investigations,” dr. johnson said. “if you have any raw milk from stump acres dairy at home, do not drink the milk and immediately discard it.”
individuals who drank raw milk purchased from stump acres dairy and became ill are advised to consult with their physician and are also urged to contact their local health department. if no illness occurred, it is not necessary to seek medical attention, but consumers should still discard the raw milk.
this consumer advisory is based on reports to the department of health about two confirmed cases and one probable case of salmonella typhimurium infection among york county residents who drank raw milk from stump acres dairy in february. additional cases of illness are suspected.
the department of agriculture has suspended sales of raw milk at the dairy and is ensuring that corrective action is taken and that multiple laboratory samples come back negative for salmonella before raw milk sales can resume.
as part of the investigation, the department of agriculture obtained three positive milk cultures from the dairy. a milk sample obtained from consumers also tested positive at the department of health’s bureau of laboratories.
stump acres dairy has a customer base of about 250 clients. the customers of the dairy are known to be from pennsylvania, maryland and virginia. no cases of salmonella infection have been identified at this time in the other states.
the shelf-life for raw milk is about 14 days but can be longer if the milk is frozen.  freezing of the milk will not kill the salmonella bacteria.
salmonella is a bacterial infection that affects the intestinal tract and can sometimes affect the bloodstream and other organs. it is one of the most common causes of gastroenteritis, which can include diarrhea and vomiting. approximately 2,000 cases of salmonella are reported each year in pennsylvania.
onset of illness usually occurs in 24 to 72 hours and patients typically recover in 5 to 7 days. patients often do not require treatment unless they become severely dehydrated or the infection spreads from the intestines. people with severe diarrhea may require rehydration, often with intravenous fluids. antibiotics are not usually necessary unless the infection spreads from the intestines.
for more information on salmonella, visit the department of health at www.health.state.pa.us or call 1-877-pa-health.

preparing ground beef for safe consumption


wash hands before and after handling raw meat with warm/hot (preferred) or cold soapy running water by rubbing hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds. also wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot (preferred), soapy water and clean up any spills right away. the mechanical action of vigorous rubbing of hands and utensils/surfaces creates friction that helps to dislodge bacteria and viruses from hands and surfaces.
additionally, warm/hot water helps to dissolve fats/foods, aiding in cleaning/microbe removal and can also assist in deactivation of pathogens. for more information on hand washing, go to http://www.cdc.gov/
handwashing . if soapy water is not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. alcohol-based hand sanitizers can reduce the number of germs on hands in some situations. however, sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs, including viruses.
keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be thoroughly cooked. use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry, and their juices and thoroughly cooked foods. thoroughly cook ground meat such as beef to an internal temperature of 160° f, as measured with a food thermometer, before eating. refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase (one hour if temperatures exceed 90° f). refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.





each case bears the establishment number ""est. 19916"" inside the usda mark of inspection, as well as any of the following identifying lot numbers: ""1018121,"" ""1019121,"" ""1018122,"" or ""1019122."" the products were produced on oct. 18 and oct. 19, 2012, and were distributed to restaurants in utah.
the problem was discovered by fsis and occurred as a result of the products testing positive for e. coli o157:h7 and being shipped prior to the company receiving test results. fsis and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with the consumption of these products. individuals concerned about an illness should contact a healthcare provider.
fsis routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers (including restaurants) of the recall and to ensure that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.e. coli o157:h7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration, and in the most severe cases, kidney failure. the very young, seniors and persons with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness.
fsis advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° f. the only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.
consumers and media with questions regarding the recall should contact the company's food safety coordinator, scott schmidt, at (801) 484-5295."

fsis advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° f. the only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.

consumption of food contaminated with l. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. an invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. in pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. in addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections can occur in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

2014,4,24,us,ontario firm recalls baby back ribs produced without import inspection,"washington, april 24, 2014 – skilcor food products, an importer of record in brampton, ontario, is recalling approximately 36 pounds of fully cooked pork baby back ribs in honey garlic barbeque sauce, because they were not presented at the border for usda fsis inspection, the u.s. department of agriculture’s food safety and inspection service (fsis) announced today. without the benefit of full inspection, a possibility of adverse health consequences exists.

fsis issues a public health alert for an imported product when the country of origin recalls the product. fsis issues a recall for an imported product when the product is not presented for inspection at the u.s. border.

the following product is subject to recall:

18 pound cases containing 1.5 pound packages of “cobblestone farms fully cooked pork baby back ribs in honey garlic barbeque sauce” bearing package code “sell by 2015-al-08” and case code “15201”
the product bears the canadian mark of inspection with establishment number “624.” the product was distributed to a retailer in new york..

the problem was discovered when fsis import staff reviewed records and discovered that the independent third party carrier did not present product for usda inspection at the u.s. – canadian border.

fsis and the company have received no reports of illness due to consumption of these products. anyone concerned about illness should contact a healthcare provider.

a failure-to-present (ftp) occurs when importers fail to present a shipment to fsis for import inspection prior to the product entering u.s. commerce. failure-to-present will result in the recall of the product.

presently, fsis analysts compare custom and border protection automated commerce environment summary data to shipments received in the fsis public health information system to identify shipments that may not have been presented for inspection at the border. as part of this process, this only occurs after the product has entered u.s. commerce.

fsis is working on solutions to prevent future failure-to-present episodes from occurring, including outreach to industry, foreign food safety agencies and importers.

consumers and media with questions about the recall should contact don bernier at (905) 501-0111.

2014,5,3,us,missouri firm recalls curry chicken salad for possible listeria contamination,"washington, may, 3, 2014– schnucks kitchen, an o’fallon, mo., establishment, is recalling approximately 130 pounds of curry white meat chicken salad product due to possible contamination with listeria monocytogenes, the u.s. department of agriculture’s food safety and inspection service (fsis) announced today.

the chicken salad product, in three-pound bags, was produced on april 24, 2014, and shipped to schnucks retail grocery locations for deli distribution in illinois, indiana, iowa, missouri and wisconsin. the following product is subject to recall:

3-lb. sealed plastic bags containing “curry white meat chicken salad with walnuts.” [view label (pdfonly)]
because the products were sold at deli counters, consumer packaging may vary. plastic containers in various sizes may bear a purchase date between april 24, 2014 and may 2, 2014. bulk case labels or packaging may bear the case code 0989674 or 0963124 as well as establishment number “est. p-13562” inside the usda mark of inspection.

the problem was discovered when routine product sampling by fsis personnel tested positive for listeria monocytogenes on april 28, 2014. this product was held by the firm and did not enter commerce. further investigative sampling by the company later determined bulk walnuts from an outside supplier, an ingredient used in the product, may have been contaminated with the pathogen. fsis and the company have received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products. fsis is working in partnership with the food and drug administration to further investigate the source of the contamination.

consumption of food contaminated with l. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. an invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. in pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. in addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

fsis and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

fsis routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. when available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the fsis website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

2014,6,11,us,missouri firm recalls ribeye and carcass products that may contain specified risk materials,"washington, june 11, 2014 – fruitland american meat, a jackson, mo. establishment is recalling approximately 4,012 pounds of fresh beef products because the dorsal root ganglia may not have been completely removed, which is not compliant with agency regulations that require their removal in cattle 30 months of age and older, the u.s. department of agriculture’s food safety and inspection service (fsis) announced today.

the products subject to recall include:

40-lb. cases containing two, roughly 20-lb. cryovac packages of bone-in “rain crow ranch ribeye” bearing the establishment number “est. 2316” inside the usda mark of inspection with the following production dates: 9/5/13, 9/10/13, 9/11/13, 9/26/13, 10/2/13, 10/3/2013, 11/8/13, 11/22/13, 12/17/13, 12/26/13, 12/27/13,1/16/14, 1/17/14, 1/23/14, 1/31/14, 2/13/14, 2/14/14, 2/21/14, 2/28/14, 3/8/14, 3/20/14, 4/4/14 or 4/25/14 printed on the box.
	quartered beef carcasses stamped with the usda mark of inspection and establishment number “est. 2316.”
the products were produced and packaged on various dates between september 2013 and april 2014. the bone-in ribeye roasts were the source material of concern.

fruitland american meat advises that the bone-in ribeye roasts were distributed to a restaurant in new york, ny, and a whole foods distribution center in connecticut which services its stores in new england. the quartered carcasses were distributed to an fsis-inspected establishment in missouri for further processing and distribution, and to a restaurant in kansas city, mo. all products would have been processed into smaller cuts with no identifying consumer packaging.

the problem was discovered by fsis during a review of company slaughter logs. the problem may have occurred as a result of the way some company employees were recording information and determining the age of various cattle. dorsal root ganglia, branches of the nervous system located in the vertebral column are considered specified risk materials (srms) and must be removed from cattle 30 months of age and older in accordance with fsis regulations. srms are tissues that may contain the infective agent in cattle infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (bse), as well as materials that are closely associated with these potentially infective tissues. therefore, fsis prohibits srms from use as human food to minimize potential human exposure to the bse agent.

every animal received ante-mortem inspection by an fsis public health veterinarian. this involves observing each animal at rest and in motion and there is no indication that any of the cattle slaughtered displayed any signs of bse.

fsis and fruitland american meat have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. anyone concerned about a reaction should contact a healthcare provider.

fsis routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. when available, the retail distribution list will be posted on the fsis website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

fsis was notified of an investigation of e. coli o157:h7 illnesses on june 25, 2014. working in conjunction with the massachusetts department of public health and the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), fsis determined that there is a link between ground beef purchased at whole foods market and this illness cluster. based on epidemiologic investigation, 3 case-patients have been identified in massachusetts with illness onset dates ranging from june 13, 2014 to june 25, 2014. while the onset of illnesses was in june, on august 13, 2014, additional laboratory results provided linkages between the 3 ma case-patients and ground beef purchased from whole foods. traceback investigation indicated that all 3 case-patients consumed ground beef purchased from 2 whole foods market prior to illness onset. fsis is continuing to work with state and federal public health partners on this investigation to determine a common source and will provide updated information as it becomes available.

e. coli o157:h7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure the organism. while most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (hus). this condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. it is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

fsis advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160 ° f. the only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cdxcdq.

consumption of food contaminated with listeria monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. an invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. in pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. in addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

fsis and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

fsis routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. when available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the fsis website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

2016,3,12,us,awareness voluntary recalls boost tea due to possible salmonella contamination,"awareness corp. of mesa, az, is recalling its 7.4 ounce container of boost tea because it may be contaminated with salmonella, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. healthy persons infected with salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. in rare circumstances, infection with salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream area and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections, endocarditis and arthritis.
no illnesses have been reported in connection with this voluntary recall.
the possibility of salmonella contamination was noted after what we have been informed was a routine testing by a third party customer of futureceuticals, a large manufacturer and supplier of organic ingredients in north america. we have been informed by a reliable source that organic spinach powder produced by futureceuticals tested positive for salmonella in another company’s product, not in boost tea. boost tea also contains this organic spinach powder ingredient obtained from supplier futureceuticals.
upon notification by the fda of futureceuticals spinach powder issues, awareness conducted its own investigation and had independent lab analysis performed by two separate analytical laboratories which confirmed a complete absence of salmonella in its boost tea product. based on awareness’ utmost concern about product safety, it is conducting this voluntary recall as a preventative measure. to prevent a recurrence of this concern, awareness has removed organic spinach powder from boost tea and expects new boost tea to be available in the next few weeks.
the voluntarily recalled boost tea was distributed nationwide by distributors from awareness. the product’s white plastic container is marked with lot #022615 on the bottom panel of the container and with an expiration date of 10/17 stamped on the container. it was first sold to distributors on or about december 15, 2015.

20 oz. pail boxes containing allfresh foods “anjoy chicken fried rice.”
case codes associated with the “anjoy chicken fried rice”product are as follows: 092415, 092915, 100215, 101315, 101615, 102015, 102715, 110315, 110615 and 032316.

the products subject to recall bear establishment number “p-31993” inside the usda mark of inspection. these items were shipped to retail distributor locations in colorado, georgia, missouri, and utah.

the problem was discovered when garland ventures ltd was notified by their supplier of vegetable fried rice, ajinomoto windsor inc., that frozen foods involved in crf frozen foods’ recall were incorporated in their products. crf frozen foods of pasco, washington voluntarily recalled frozen vegetable items due to an illness outbreak of listeriosis. there have been no confirmed reports of illness or adverse reactions due to consumption of garland ventures’ products.

listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. an invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. in pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. in addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

fsis and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. these products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

2016,6,16,us,essential foods recalls four flavors of globespun gourmet wraps because of possible health risk,"essential foods inc. of seattle, washington is voluntarily recalling four flavors of globespun gourmet 8oz wraps because an ingredient (peas) has the potential to be contaminated with listeria monocytogenes, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. although healthy individuals may suffer only short term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
the recalled globespun gourmet wraps were distributed in washington and oregon to grocery outlets and corporate cafeterias.
the products come in 8oz, plastic wrapped, ready to eat form. the affected products are the following flavors:
the products have a date stamp of 06 17, 06 20 and 06 24 on the bottom of the wrap.
no illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem.
the potential for contamination is connected to a recall of frozen peas which had the potential of testing positive for listeria monocytogens. peas are used in the above recipes and are therefore affiliated with the recall.
the production of the product has been suspended while fda and our supplier work to resolve the source of the issue.
consumers who have purchased 8oz globespun gourmet thai, coconut curry, tandoori or dolma la wraps are urged to return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. consumers with questions may contact the company at 1-206-545-4194"
2016,6,16,us,hellofresh recalls frozen peas because of possible health risk,"hellofresh of new york, n.y. is recalling frozen peas due to notification from a supplier that the peas have the potential to be contaminated with listeria monocytogenes. the peas were included in hellofresh recipe kits delivered the week of june 11-15, 2016 and the weeks of march 12-25, 2016.
listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
currently, no illnesses or customer complaints have been reported to date, however, in an abundance of caution, the company has decided to conduct this voluntary recall. hellofresh immediately informed their affected customers of the recall and advised them to discard the product.
the peas were delivered by a third party delivery service in colorado, new mexico, nebraska, kansas, oklahoma, texas, louisiana, arkansas, missouri, iowa, minnesota, wisconsin, illinois, ohio, indiana, kentucky, mississippi, alabama, tennessee, florida, and georgia, as part of the meals ""summer vegetable salad with seared chicken, garlic croutons, and mustard-chive vinaigrette"" (june 11-15, 2016), ""lemony pan-seared chicken with pesto potato salad and peas"" (march 12-18, 2016), and ""seared steak with spring veggie succotash and mint-chive pesto"" and ""nir's lamb-stuffed zucchini with spiced lentil stew"" (march 19-25, 2016). we expect that the march items have already been consumed and no cases of illness have been reported. the peas would have arrived in a portion cup inside a kit box labeled with the recipe names described above.
the pea is most commonly the small spherical seed of the pod fruit pisum sativum. customers in these states are encouraged to discard the entire kit box, and not eat any of the ingredients from that recipe. following the cooking preparation instructions printed on each individual case will effectively reduce the risk of exposure to this bacterium.
if you have any concerns or are experiencing symptoms linked to this recall, please contact your healthcare provider immediately. if you have any additional questions, please call hellofresh 1-800-733-2414 during the hours of 6am est to 11pm est monday through friday and 6am est to 7:30pm est saturday and sunday."

the problem was discovered when a supplier notified kabob’s acquisition, inc. that flour sold to the establishment was recalled by general mills due to possible association with a multi-state escherichia coli o121 illness outbreak. there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these kabob’s acquisition, inc. products. 

general mills’ recall can be found at: http://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls/ucm509693.htm 

many clinical laboratories do not test for non-o157 shiga toxin-producing e. coli (stec), such as stec o121 because it is harder to identify than stec o157. people can become ill from stecs 2–8 days (average of 3–4 days) after consuming the organism. most people infected with stec o121 develop diarrhea (often bloody), and vomiting. some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment; antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended. 

most people recover within a week, but, rarely, some develop a more severe infection. hemolytic uremic syndrome (hus) is uncommon with stec o121 infection. hus can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old, older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. it is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

fsis and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. these products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

2016,7,31,us,hampton creek issues voluntary recall of mixes containing native forest coconut milk powder because of possible health risk,"san francisco, ca. - out of an abundance of caution, hampton creek is undertaking a voluntary recall of 6 sku’s of baking mixes that contain the native forest coconut milk powder. the ingredient, which makes up less than 1.31% of the mixes, tested positive for salmonella in a company-initiated testing program. hampton creek immediately notified native forest and their distributor, and has requested they initiate a voluntary recall of all their native forest coconut milk powder-in all formats-with all retail and food manufacturing customers.
the affected mixes, available nation-wide, are as follows:
per the fda’s website, “salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. healthy persons infected with salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. in rare circumstances, infection with salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis, and arthritis.”
as part of hampton creek’s testing program, 30 native forest coconut milk powder samples were pulled and tested. 29 of the samples tested negative and one sample tested positive for salmonella. 74 additional samples taken from other lots of the native forest coconut milk powder tested negative.
no other hampton creek products were affected, and there have been no reports of any health issues.
all finished mixes released into the market tested negative for any pathogens, but with the presence of salmonella in the native forest coconut milk powder, we notified the fda of the potential health risk. consumers who have purchased any of the recalled products should not consume the product, and either discard it or return it to the retailer for a full refund.
“nothing else matters without safety,” said hampton creek’s founder and ceo, josh tetrick. “the guidance we’ve received from the fda has been vital to ensuring any affected product is removed from the marketplace. you can reach me directly any time at 415.404.2372 or the company at 844.423.6637, m-f 9:00-6pm pst, and wecare@hamptoncreek.com with any and all questions or concerns.”
with the health and safety of consumers being the company’s top priority, hampton creek decided to inform the fda of the native forest coconut milk powder concern 2 days before the confirmed test result.

fsis and the company are concerned that some of this recalled product may be in food service distribution refrigerators.

2016,12,2,us,"royal seafood baza, inc. recalls various ready to eat herring products because of possible health risk","royal seafood baza, inc. of staten, island, new york is recalling various refrigerated ready to eat herring products because they have the potential to be contaminated with listeria monocytogenes, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
the affected ready to eat herring products were distributed to customers located new york, new jersey, pennsylvania, ohio, oregon, texas, and north carolina. wholesale customers of bulk containers must discontinue sales of existing stock of these items immediately and destroy any returned product as soon as possible.
this recall action is specific to the following products:
the bulk herring products have pack dates of “11/2/16” – “11/30/16”.  the herring products packaged in retail containers have best before dates of: 11.30.2016 through 02.28.2017. herring products packaged in vacuum packaged bags include pack dates of 11.09.16 - 11.30.16.

2016,12,2,us,fda advises consumers not to eat apple tree goat dairy goat cheese products because of possible listeria contamination,"products test positive for listeria monocytogenes
on this page:
on september 12, 2016, fda began its inspection of apple tree’s manufacturing facility in richfield, pa. in addition to observing poor sanitation practices, fda took environmental samples that identified listeria monocytogenes in 18 environmental samples from apple tree’s processing, packaging, and storage areas, including food-contact surfaces such as a cheese slicer, cheese mold, tables, and plates used to hold cheese before packaging. fda also tested apple tree’s goat cheese. two of the finished goat cheeses and 18 of the environmental samples tested positive for listeria monocytogenes.
on september 20, 2016, apple tree initiated a voluntary recall of the four lots of goat cheeses that pda tested and found positive for listeria monocytogenes. later in september, apple tree expanded its recall to include all of its goat cheeses, but fda is not aware of any public notification to consumers announcing the expanded recall. accordingly, fda is issuing this release and working with pda to monitor this situation and take appropriate actions to protect consumers from apple tree goat cheeses that may have been exposed to or contaminated with listeria monocytogenes.
listeriosis is a rare but serious illness usually caused by eating food contaminated with the bacteria called listeria monocytogenes. anyone who experiences fever and muscle aches, sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms, or develops fever and chills while pregnant should tell their health care provider about eating a potentially contaminated food. symptoms can appear from a few days up to a few weeks after consumption of the contaminated food. read more about food safety tips for expectant mothers: http://www.fda.gov/food/foodborneillnesscontaminants/peopleatrisk/ucm083320.htm
listeriosis, the third leading cause of death from food poisoning, targets pregnant women and their fetuses, people with weakened immune systems, and those 65 years of age or older. listeriosis hits these high-risk groups the hardest, accounting for at least 90 percent of reported listeria infections and resulting in higher rates of hospitalization and death than most other foodborne bacteria. in pregnant women, listeriosis can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, premature labor, and serious illness or death in newborn babies.
retailers and restaurants should not serve or sell any apple tree goat cheeses and should dispose of them. if they do not know the source of their goat cheeses, they should check with their distributor or apple tree.
wash and sanitize display cases and refrigerators where potentially contaminated products were stored.
wash and sanitize cutting boards, surfaces, and utensils used to cut, serve, or store apple tree goat cheeses.
wash hands with warm water and soap following the cleaning and sanitation process.
retailers, restaurants, and other food service operators who have processed and packaged any apple tree goat cheeses need to be concerned about cross-contamination of cutting surfaces and utensils through contact with the potentially contaminated products.
regular frequent cleaning and sanitizing of cutting boards and utensils used in processing may help to minimize the likelihood of cross-contamination.
listeria can grow at refrigeration temperatures in foods. listeria can also cross-contaminate other food cut and served on the same cutting board or stored in the same area.
retailers, restaurants, and other food service operators may wish to consider whether other foods available for sale could have been cross-contaminated from apple tree goat cheeses, and should be discarded.
firms who have re-labeled, re-packed, or used these apple tree goat cheeses to produce new products that have not received a thermal kill step should contact the fda recall coordinator in your state to determine whether or not you should initiate a recall of your product(s). fda district recall coordinators for each state are listed at: http://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls/industryguidance/ucm129334.htm.
the fda urges consumers to not eat any apple tree goat cheeses, to check their homes for the cheeses, and to throw them away.
to help avoid these goat cheeses contaminating any other foods, consumers should follow these simple steps:
•wash hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds before and after handling food. •wash the inside walls and shelves of the refrigerator, cutting boards and countertops; then sanitize them with a solution of one tablespoon of chlorine bleach to one gallon of hot water; then dry with a clean cloth  or paper towel that has not been previously used. •wipe-up spills in the refrigerator immediately and clean the refrigerator regularly. •always wash hands with warm water and soap following the cleaning and sanitization process.  
additional recommendations for preventing listeriosis are available at the cdc listeria website: http://www.cdc.gov/listeria/prevention.html.
consumers with questions may contact the apple tree goat dairy at 717-694-0146 monday thru friday 8:00am to 5:00pm est.
the fda also encourages consumers with questions about food safety to call 1-888-safefood monday through friday between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. eastern time, or to consult the fda.gov website:

2017,3,20,us,"h & b packing co., inc. recalls boneless beef products due to possible e. coli o103 contamination","editors note: this release is being updated to reflect the accurate poundage and description of products included in the recall release issued march 19, 2017.


washington, march 19, 2017 – h & b packing co., inc., a waco, texas establishment, is recalling approximately 79,461 pounds of boneless beef products that may be contaminated with e. coli o103, the u.s. department of agriculture’s food safety and inspection service (fsis) announced today.

the boneless beef items were produced on march 6, 2017. the following products are subject to recall:[label]

60-lb. box containing boneless beef with case code 69029 and production date 03/06/17.

multiple combo bins containing 73,682-lbs of boneless beef with case code 69029 and production date 03/06/17.

two combo bins containing 4,095-lb of “beef chuck” with case code 73033 and production date 03/06/17.

combo bin containing 1,624-lb of “beef 94s combos” with case code 118078 and production date 3/06/17.
the products subject to recall bear establishment number “est. m13054” inside the usda mark of inspection. these items were shipped to food manufacturers within the state of texas.

the problem was discovered when fsis was notified by the state of texas’ meat safety assurance unit about a positive non-o157 shiga toxin-producing e. coli sample.

there have been no confirmed reports of illnesses due to consumption of these products.

many clinical laboratories do not test for non-o157 shiga toxin-producing e. coli (stec), such as stec o103 because it is harder to identify than stec o157. people can become ill from stecs 2–8 days (average of 3–4 days) after consuming the organism. most people infected with stec o103 develop diarrhea (often bloody), and vomiting. some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment; antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended.

most people recover within a week, but, rarely, some develop a more severe infection. hemolytic uremic syndrome (hus) is uncommon with stec o103 infection. hus can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old, older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. it is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

fsis and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in customers' freezers.

customers who have purchased these products are urged not to use them. these products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

fsis routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. when available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the fsis website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

fsis advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground meat that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° f. the only way to confirm that ground meat is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cdxcdq.

media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact kris shirey, h&b packing co., inc., q.a. supervisor, at (254) 752-2506.

product was distributed in washington, wyoming, utah, montana, oregon, california, nevada, idaho, arizona, and texas between 6/17/2017 and 10/13/17 through food service operations, retail stores, and restaurants. product was distributed as 3 to 5 lb. vacuum-packed, frozen, whole tuna loins packed in 30 lb. newport brand master cases; 5 to 8 lb. vacuum-packed, frozen, whole tuna loins packed in 30 lb. newport brand master cases; 6 oz. vacuum-packed tuna steaks in 10 lb. newport brand master cases; and 4 oz. vacuum-packed tuna steaks in 10 lb. newport brand master cases. master cases are labeled with the production lot codes of mtnt 0947c, mtnt 0957b, mtnt 0967a, mtnt 0977d, mtnt 0917b, mtnt 0937d, gnd 0737d, gnd 0747e, gnd 0757a, gnd 0767c, gnd 0777b, gnd 0697b, gnd 0707c and gnd 0727a.

journey cuisine notified fsis on oct. 30, 2017 that one of its products, burrito carnitas caliente, had tested positive for l. monocytogenes during the firm’s product testing. after a review of the ingredients used in the burrito carnitas caliente, the company determined that four additional products may be affected. there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products.

consumption of food contaminated with l. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. an invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. in pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. in addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

fsis and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. these products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

fsis routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. when available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the fsis website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

on february 9, 2018, fsis was notified by health officials in iowa of an investigation of salmonella typhimurium illnesses. the iowa department of public health, iowa department of inspections and appeals, and iowa state hygienic laboratory determined that there is a link between the chicken salad from triple t specialty meats, inc. and this outbreak. based on epidemiological investigation, 37 confirmed case-patients have been identified in iowa, with illness onset dates ranging from january 14, 2018 to february 6, 2018. results are pending on whether the outbreak strain is resistant to antibiotics. the iowa department of inspections and appeals and department of public health issued a joint consumer advisory issued for chicken salad purchased at fareway grocery stores on february 13, 2018, advising consumers to throw away any remaining chicken salad product. the chicken salad product subject to recall was purchased from january 4, 2018 to february 9, 2018 in various weight containers from the deli sections in fareway grocery stores.

fsis continues to work with state and federal health officials to determine if there are additional illnesses linked to this product, including illnesses in states outside of iowa. this product was sold at fareway grocery stores in iowa, illinois, minnesota, nebraska and south dakota. fsis will provide updated information as it becomes available.

consumption of food contaminated with salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. the most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. the illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. most people recover without treatment. in some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

fsis and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers. consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. these products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

fsis routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. when available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the fsis website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

fsis advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume chicken salad that has been cooked to a temperature of 165° f. the only way to confirm that chicken salad is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cdxcdq.

2018,3,29,us,"target corporation recalls frozen ready-to-eat and non-ready-to-eat meat and poultry products due to possible temperature abuse during transport at a single store on oahu, honolulu, hi","washington, march 29, 2018 – target corporation, located in minneapolis, minn.is recalling an undetermined amount of frozen ready-to-eat and not-ready-to-eat meat and poultry products due to temperature abuse during transport, which may have resulted in the growth of spoilage organisms or pathogens, the u.s. department of agriculture’s food safety and inspection service (fsis) announced today. temperature abuse, during which the product was at temperatures greater than 60°f for over five hours, may result in the growth of the proliferation of bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, shiga-toxin producing e. coli, listeria monocytogenes and salmonella. the frozen ready-to-eat and not-ready-to-eat meat and poultry items were sold from march 23, 2018 to march 27, 2018. the complete list of products, product labels and upc code numbers can be found here. these items were shipped to one target retail store in hawaii located at 1450 ala moana blvd, ste 2401, honolulu, hi 96814. the problem was discovered on march 27, 2018 when the company received temperature records of the shipment from the carrier. all inventory of the impacted items have been removed from the store and destroyed. target notified fsis that the product from the shipping container had been temperature abused on march 28, 2018. bacillus cereusis a type of bacteria that can be found in a variety of foods that have been stored too long at room temperature. emetic toxins produced by bacillus cereus are characterizeed by nausea and vomiting occurring within 30 minutes to six hours after consumption of contaminated foods. staphylococcus aureusis a common bacteria found on the skin and in the noses of healthy people and animals.staphylococcus aureuscan produce seven different toxins that are frequently responsible for food poisoning. most people infected with e.coli develop diarrhea (often bloody) and vomiting. some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment; antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended. most people recover within a week, but, rarely, some develop a more severe infection. some kinds of e. coli bacteria cause disease when they make a toxin called shiga toxin. the bacteria that make these toxins are called “shiga toxin-producing e. coli,” or stec for short. the most common type of stec in the united states is e.coli o157:h7. persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately. consumption of food contaminated with listeria monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected. listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. an invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. in pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. in addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food. consumption of food contaminated withsalmonellacan cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. the most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. the illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. most people recover without treatment. in some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider. there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider. fsis is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers’ freezers. consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. these products should be thrown away. consumers should call target guest relations for a refund at 1-800-440-0680. fsis routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. members of the media with questions about the recall can contact jenna reck, senior public relations manager, at (612) 761-5829. consumers with questions about the recall and to obtain a refund can contact target guest relations, at 1-800-440-0680. consumers with food safety questions can ""ask karen,"" the fsis virtual representative available 24 hours a day at askkaren.gov or via smartphone at m.askkaren.gov. the toll-free usda meat and poultry hotline 1-888-mphotline (1-888-674-6854) is available in english and spanish and can be reached from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (eastern time) monday through friday. recorded food safety messages are available 24 hours a day. the online electronic consumer complaint monitoring system can be accessed 24 hours a day at: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/reportproblem."
2018,4,3,us,nutrizone expands recall of various lots of multiple dietary supplements because of possible salmonella health risk,"nutrizone, llc of houston, texas is updating an incorrectly reported lot number provided in an earlier press release.  previously, nutrizone indicated the paint out maeng da lot number was 10957.  the correct lot number is 10959.  consumers who have purchased the products should verify the lot number.

2018,4,6,us,advocare issues allergy alert in select bottles of muscle strength and nighttime recovery product because of undeclared milk allergen on the label,"advocare international has commenced a voluntary recall of two lots of muscle strength and four lots of nighttime recovery dietary supplements because they may contain undeclared milk that can elicit an allergic reaction in individuals who are sensitive to milk and milk products.
individuals who are highly sensitive to milk protein who consumed caplets from these lots may experience symptoms common to a milk allergy including gastrointestinal issues or allergenic skin reactions. even in those instances involving more intense reactions, any anticipated effects are expected to resolve quickly and typically do not require medical treatment.
product was distributed nationwide through advocare and our independent distributors. affected product includes 15,640 units of muscle strength, product code: p3221 with lot numbers: 7063341, 7082161, and sold between november 15, 2017 - march 29, 2018 and 48,176 units of nighttime recovery, product code: p3201 lot numbers: 7081841, 7063321, 7052411, 7090471, sold between december 15, 2017 - march 28, 2018.
no reports of adverse events due to a milk allergen had been reported prior to the recall.
as part of a routine formula review, a prospective manufacturer indicated the presence of milk in ashwagandha, a raw ingredient common to both muscle strength and nighttime recovery. after advocare was alerted to the possibility of trace amounts of milk in both products, we immediately conducted an investigation and engaged a third-party health hazard evaluation. the investigation concluded that ashwagandha was extracted using milk. therefore, trace amounts of milk can be detected in these specific lots. the risk of a mild or severe adverse reaction exists but is extremely low (i.e., less than 0.5% of the adult population). advocare suspended sales of nighttime recovery and muscle strength while issuing the voluntary recall. communications were sent to all distributors and customers who purchased the affected product through the advocare website. distributors were instructed to contact any customer to whom they sold the product in-person using the sample email communication.
if you purchased any of the affected product, advocare is urging consumers to call customer service at 1-800- 542-4800 from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. mon - fri for a full refund or exchange of the product."

the pasta salad was distributed to all of hy-vee’s 244 grocery stores across its eight-state region of iowa, illinois, missouri, kansas, nebraska, south dakota, minnesota and wisconsin. the product comes in a plastic container with a plastic lid. the expiration date range is between june 22, 2018, and aug. 3, 2018. the expiration date can be found on the side of the container.

2018,8,15,us,zakah life recalls kratom because of possible health risk,"zakah life, llc of ankeny, iowa, is recalling the following kratom products (super green maeng da premium kratom powder, powerful red vein bali premium kratom powder, super green maeng da premium kratom capsules, and powerful red vein bali premium kratom capsules) with expiration dates prior to 01/01/2023 because they have the potential of being contaminated with salmonella, an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. healthy persons infected with salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. in rare circumstances, infection with salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurisms), endocarditis, and arthritis.
the recalled kratom products were distributed nationwide in retail stores and through mail orders.
the affected products, lot, best by dates and packaging are as follows:
no illnesses have been reported to date in connection with this problem.

2018,9,26,us,mauna loa macadamia nut corporation voluntarily recalls,"keaau, hi (september 24, 2018) – mauna loa macadamia nut corporation is voluntarily recalling all of its products produced at the keaau facility between sept. 6 - 21, 2018 due to a potential contamination of escherichia coli (e. coli). the recall was initiated due to e.coli being detected in the well water and distribution system that supplies the firm’s operations. no illnesses related to the water have been reported to the state.
mauna loa is voluntarily recalling their products out of an abundance of caution under the advisement of the hawaii state department of health (doh).
e. coli bacteria can exist in tropical, sub-tropical and temperate soil and may persist in soil for a number of years. e. coli are bacteria whose presence indicates that the water may be contaminated with human or animal wastes. microbes in these wastes can cause diarrhea, cramps, nausea, headaches, or other symptoms. they may pose a special health risk for infants, young children, some of the elderly, and people with severely compromised immune systems.
on sept. 21, 2018 doh notified mauna loa that a water sample in their distribution system was positive for e. coli. it was thought that a possible reason for contamination was the result of a disinfection system malfunction.
mauna loa macadamia nut corporation took immediate action to notify employees and the public within 24 hours of receiving notification from doh of the possibility of contamination. it was advised that the mauna loa macadamia nut water system consumers and employees not drink/consume the water while investigations continued.
subsequent test samples remained positive for e.coli and the state doh has advised mauna loa to recall its products as an additional safety measure. the firm has been closed since sept. 21, 2018 and will remain closed until the water clears state doh drinking water standards. the doh has been in constant communication with mauna loa regarding the issue to ensure all safety standards are being met.
the products, produced between sept. 6 - 21, 2018, and listed on the following pages are being recalled due to possible contamination with e. coli.
product recall information:
the above products were packaged in keaau, hawaii and sold only in retail stores in hawaii. consumers who have purchased the recalled products should discard the products immediately or attempt to return them to the store where purchased.
mauna loa is committed to the highest industry standards and is working diligently to determine the cause of the contamination. the facility has multiple safeguards in place to ensure safety and quality and is reviewing its process thoroughly to avoid any future contamination issues. mauna loa utilizes the haccp (hazard analysis and critical control points) management system as one of the ways it addresses food safety. it is also fully compliant with the u.s. food and drug administration fsma (food safety modernization act).
general guidelines on ways to lessen the risk of infection by microbes are available from the epa safe drinking water hotline at 1(800) 426-4791.

2018,10,18,us,hy-vee voluntarily recalls several meat and potato products,"hy-vee, inc., based in west des moines, iowa, is voluntarily recalling six of its meat and potato products across its eight-state region due to possible contamination with salmonella and listeria monocytogenes. the potential for contamination was discovered after hy-vee's supplier, mccain foods, announced it was recalling its caramelized mushrooms and fire-roasted tomatoes, which are ingredients that are used in six hy-vee products. to date, no illnesses have been reported in connection with these products.
salmonella is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. healthy persons infected with salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. in rare circumstances, infection with salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
listeria monocytogenes is an organism, which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, listeria monocytogenes infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
out of an abundance of caution, hy-vee is recalling the following products from all of its stores:
all impacted products have a ""best if used by"" date of oct. 22, 2018, or sooner.

washington, dec. 21, 2018 – jennie-o turkey store sales, inc., a faribault, minn. establishment, is recalling approximately 164,210 pounds of raw ground turkey products that may be contaminated with salmonella reading, the u.s. department of agriculture’s food safety and inspection service (fsis) announced today.

the raw ground turkey items were produced on october 22, 2018 and october 23, 2018. the following products are subject to recall: [view labels (pdf only)]

the products subject to recall bear establishment number “est. p-579” inside the usda mark of inspection or on the side of the tray. these items were shipped to retail locations nationwide.

fsis and its public health partners, including the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), the michigan department of health and human services, and the michigan department of agriculture and rural development, have been conducting traceback activities for a sample of jennie-o brand ground turkey in an intact, unopened package from a case-patient’s home. the patient tested positive for salmonella reading and the samples from the case-patient and from the ground turkey are closely related genetically.

this investigation is part of a larger effort involving fsis, the cdc, and state public health and agriculture partners, who have been working together on an illness cluster involving 216 case-patients in 38 states and the district of columbia. patients have reported eating different types and brands of turkey products purchased from many different stores, handling raw turkey pet food and/or raw turkey, or working with live turkeys or living with someone who handled live turkeys. fsis continues to work with the cdc and state health and agriculture departments on this larger investigation and will provide updated information as it becomes available. based on the continuing investigation, additional product from other companies may also be recalled.

consumption of food contaminated with salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. the most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. the illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. most people recover without treatment. in some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

fsis is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers’ freezers. consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. these products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

fsis routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. when available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the fsis website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

fsis advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume raw poultry product that has been cooked to a temperature of 165°f. safe steps in food handling, cooking, and storage are essential in preventing foodborne illness. you can't see, smell, or taste harmful bacteria that may cause illness. in every step of food preparation, follow the four guidelines to keep food safe:

clean—wash hands and surfaces often.
	separate—separate raw meat from other foods.
	cook—cook to the right temperature.
	chill—refrigerate food promptly.

recall of ""crottin de pays"" goat cheese from france 
 
the european commission rapid alert system for food and feed (rasff) 
has issued a notification that 2 batches of “crottin de pays” goat cheese from france 
have been recalled due to high count of escherichia coli (e. coli) bacteria. 
 
2 as there is import of the implicated product into singapore, the singapore 
food agency (sfa) has directed the importer to recall the product. the implicated 
goat cheeses have not been distributed to the market for sale, and are stored in the 
importer’s warehouse.  
 
unpasteurised milk cheese 
3      consumers who choose to consume unpasteurised milk cheese must be aware 
of the risks involved. unpasteurised milk is likely to contain more bacteria and other 
pathogens compared to pasteurised milk. this may include e. coli bacteria, which can 
cause food poisoning. as a precaution, vulnerable groups of people, especially young 
children, pregnant women, elderly persons, or people with chronic illness such as 
diabetes, should avoid consuming unpasteurised food products. consumers who do 
not feel well after consumption of unpasteurised milk cheese should seek medical 
attention. 
 
4      the key to preventing foodborne illnesses lies in good food hygiene and food 
safety practices. consumers are advised to: 
 thoroughly cook raw food from animal sources; 
 keep raw food separate from vegetables, fruits, cooked and ready-to-eat food; 
 avoid unpasteurised milk or foods made from unpasteurised milk; 
 wash hands, utensils, or food preparation surfaces before and after handling 
raw food.

2019,11,16,us,"central valley meat co., inc. recalls ground beef products due to possible salmonella dublin contamination","editor’s note:fsis and our public health partners, including the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) and state public health officials, are investigating a salmonella dublin outbreak. please note that fsis is continuing to investigate illnesses associated with this outbreak and their sources and additional product may be recalled.


washington, nov. 15, 2019 – central valley meat co., inc., a hanford, calif. establishment, is recalling approximately 34,222 pounds of ground beef products that may be contaminated with salmonella dublin, the u.s. department of agriculture’s food safety and inspection service (fsis) announced today.

the ground beef items were produced on july 23, 2019. the following products are subject to recall: [view labels (pdf only)]

1-lb. chub packages of “stater bros. 100% pure ground beef 96% lean 4% fat” with lot 2049 on the retail label; lot 19204 on the case label; and use by 08-14-19.

2-lb. chub packages of “stater bros. 100% pure ground beef 93% lean 7% fat” with lot 2049 on the retail label; lot 19204 on the case label; and use by 08-14-19.

20-lb. cases containing “stater bros 93/7 ground beef 10# chub 10 lb. chubs/ 2 count” with lot 19204 on the case label and use by 08-14-19.
the products subject to recall bear establishment number “est. 6063a” printed on the retail labels next to the lot number and inside the usda mark of inspection on the case labels. these items were shipped to retail locations in california.

fsis was notified of an investigation of salmonella dublin illnesses on september 9, 2019. working in conjunction with the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), and state and local public health partners, fsis determined that there is a link between ground beef products from central valley meat co., inc., and this illness cluster. the traceback investigation indicated that a case-patient consumed ground beef produced by central valley meat co., inc. based on epidemiological investigation, 10 case-patients have been identified in 6 states with illness onset dates ranging from august 8, 2019 to september 22, 2019. additional information may be found on the cdc website at https://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/dublin-11-19/index.html. this outbreak strain of salmonella dublin did not identify any antibiotic resistance. fsis continues to work with the cdc and state and local public health partners on this investigation and will provide updated information as it becomes available.

consumption of food contaminated with salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. the most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. the illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. most people recover without treatment. in some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

fsis is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ freezers. consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. these products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

fsis routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. when available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the fsis website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

fsis advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160°f. the only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, https://www.fsis.usda.gov/safetempchart.

  fsis announcement
  
  
  
            the u.s. department of agriculture’s food safety and inspection service (fsis) is issuing a public health alert because approximately 70 pounds of raw beef ravioli products, produced by p&s ravioli company, a philadelphia, pa. establishment, may be contaminated withe. colio157:h7. a recall was not requested because the affected product is no longer available for purchase.
however, fsis is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ freezers. consumers who have purchased these products should not consume them. these products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.
the frozen, raw ground beef ravioli items were produced on april 30, 2020. the following product is subject to the public health alert:
13-oz. boxes containing “p&s ravoli company 12 jumbo meat ravioli” with a use-by date of 11/30/2020 and lot code 20121.
the products bear establishment number “est. 2736” inside the usda mark of inspection. these items were shipped to a limited number of retail locations in new jersey and pennsylvania.
the problem was discovered when p&s ravioli company was notified by their third-party laboratory that a sample was positive fore. colio157:h7, but the products associated with the sample had already been shipped into commerce. the establishment notified fsis of the sampling results and subsequently controlled all product remaining for sale.
there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.
e. colio157:h7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause dehydration, bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps 2–8 days (3–4 days, on average) after exposure the organism. while most people recover within a week, some develop a type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (hus). this condition can occur among persons of any age but is most common in children under 5-years old and older adults. it is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.
fsis advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume raw ground beef product that has been cooked to a temperature of 160°f. the only way to confirm that frozen raw ground beef ravioli products are cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures safe internal temperature.

fsis advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160°f. the only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, https://www.fsis.usda.gov/safetempchart.

            washington, aug. 7, 2020– the u.s. department of agriculture’s food safety and inspection service (fsis) is issuing a public health alert because bluegrass provisions co., a crescent springs, ky. establishment, produced sausage products that may be contaminated withlisteria monocytogenes. a recall was not requested because it is believed that all products are no longer in commerce and are past their use or freeze by dates.
the ready-to-eat smoked sausage items were produced on apr. 22, 2020. the following products subject to the public health alert are:
14-oz. plastic packages containing 6 pieces of “blue grass mettwurst,” with a use or freeze by date of july 23, 2020.
14-oz. plastic packages containing 6 pieces of “walnut creek foods smoked sausage,” with a use or freeze by date of july 23, 2020.

14-oz. plastic packages containing 6 pieces of lidl “smoked bratwurst with cheese,” with a use or freeze by date of july 23, 2020.
the products bear establishment number “est. 7417” inside the usda mark of inspection. these items were shipped to distributors and retail locations in kentucky, ohio, north carolina, and virginia.
the problem was discovered by routine testing and the results showed one of the products was contaminated withlisteria monocytogenes.the additional products may be affected by cross-contamination.
consumption of food contaminated withl. monocytogenescan cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.
listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. an invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. in pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. in addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections can occur in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.
fsis is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ freezers. consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. these products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.
fsis advises all consumers to reheat ready-to-eat product until steaming hot.

  fsis announcement
  
  
  
            the u.s. department of agriculture’s food safety and inspection service (fsis) is issuing a public health alert because whole foods market, inc., sold an undetermined amount of beef meatballs with marinara sauce that were misbranded and were produced with an undeclared allergen. the products contain parmesan cheese made from milk, which is a known allergen, and is not declared on the product label. fsis is issuing this public health alert out of the utmost of caution to ensure that consumers with allergic reactions to milk are aware that these products should not be consumed. a recall was not requested because it is believed that the affected products are no longer available to be directly purchased by retail consumers.
the beef meatballs with marinara sauce products subject to the public health alert are:
24-oz. clear plastic containers of “whole foods market beef meatballs with marinara” with a plu code of 39496 and sell-by dates through 2/27/21.
this product was soldin retail locations in illinois, indiana, iowa, kentucky, michigan, minnesota, missouri, ohio and wisconsin.
the problem was discovered when the firm notified fda of a customer report of an adverse reaction due to consumption of the product. anyone concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider.
fsis is concerned that some product may be in consumers’ refrigerators or freezers. consumers with food allergies who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. these products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.
consumers and members of the media with questions about the public health alert can contact nathan cimbala, global public relations, whole foods market, inc., at nathan.cimbala@wholefoods.com.
consumers with food safety questions can call the toll-free usda meat and poultry hotline at 1-888-mphotline (1-888-674-6854) or live chat via ask usda from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (eastern time) monday through friday. consumers can also browse food safety messages at ask usda or send a question via email to mphotline@usda.gov. for consumers that need to report a problem with a meat, poultry, or egg product, the online electronic consumer complaint monitoring system can be accessed 24 hours a day at https://foodcomplaint.fsis.usda.gov/eccf/.

  fsis announcement
  
  
  
            editor’s notes: on april 12, the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) issued a food safety alert for the salmonella hadar outbreak linked to ground turkey.

this public health alert was updated on april 12, 2021 to reflect the recent change made by the centers for disease control and prevention regarding the incubation period for salmonella. the most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever which may begin within 6 hours to 6 days after infection.

washington, april 10, 2021 – the u.s. department of agriculture’s food safety and inspection service (fsis) is issuing a public health alert for approximately 211,406 pounds of raw ground turkey products, produced by plainville brands, llc, a pennsylvania establishment, due to concerns the products may have caused salmonella hadar illness. a recall was not requested because it is believed that the products are no longer available for consumers to purchase.

fsis is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers’ freezers. consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. these products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase. retail locations that may receive returned product from consumers should destroy this product immediately.

the raw ground turkey products were produced on december 18, 2020 through december 29, 2020. the following products are subject to the public health alert:

1-lb. packages of nature’s promise free from 94% lean | 6% fat ground turkey with use by/freeze/sell by date of 1/1/21, 1/3/21,1/4/21, 1/8/21 and 1/10/21 on the front of the package.
	1-lb. packages of wegman 94% lean | 6% fat ground turkey with use by/freeze/sell by date of 1/3/21, 1/4/21, 1/8/21 and 1/10/21 on the front of the package.
	3-lb. packages of wegman 94% lean | 6% fat ground turkey with use by/freeze/sell by date of 1/3/21, 1/4/21, 1/8/21 and 1/10/21 on the front of the package.
	1-lb. packages of plainville farms ground white turkey 93% | 7% fat with use by/freeze/sell by date of 1/10/21 on the front of the package.
the products bear establishment number est. p-244 inside the usda mark of inspection. these items were shipped to retail locations nationwide.

fsis and its public health partners, including the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), public health and regulatory officials are investigating a multistate outbreak of 28 salmonella hadar illnesses in 12 states with onset dates ranging from december 28, 2020 through march 4, 2021. the traceback investigation for one case patient identified the patient consumed ground turkey produced by plainville brands, llc. an intact, unopened package of plainville brands’ ground turkey collected from this case-patient’s home tested positive for salmonella hadar and was closely related genetically to the sample from the patient. evidence collected to date does not link all illnesses to this establishment. based on the continuing investigation, additional product from other establishments may be involved. fsis continues to work with cdc and state and local public health partners on this investigation and will provide updated information as it becomes available.

consumption of food contaminated with salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. the most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within6 hours to 6 daysafter eating the contaminated product. the illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. most people recover without treatment. in some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

fsis advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume raw ground turkey that has been cooked to a temperature of 165°f. the only way to confirm the poultry item is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, https://www.fsis.usda.gov/safetempchart.

consumers and members of the media with questions about the public health alert can contact yusef robb at (323)384-1789 or by email at yusef@tkcommunicationsllc.com.

consumers with food safety questions can call the toll-free usda meat and poultry hotline at 1-888-mphotline (1-888-674-6854) or live chat via ask usda from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (eastern time) monday through friday. consumers can also browse food safety messages at ask usda or send a question via email to mphotline@usda.gov. for consumers that need to report a problem with a meat, poultry, or egg product, the online electronic consumer complaint monitoring system can be accessed 24 hours a day at https://foodcomplaint.fsis.usda.gov/eccf/.

the items being recalled are: haddock, monkfish, bone-in trout, grouper, red snapper, red rock cod, ocean perch, pacific cod, halibut, coho salmon, atlantic salmon portions, lane snapper, tilapia, all natural salmon fillet, pacific sole, and farm raised striped bass.

these items were distributed from may 2021 to october 7, 2021 to restaurants and albertsons, safeway, and sprouts supermarkets in colorado. the recalled items would have sold out of their fresh seafood cases. the pacific cod sold through sprouts is not being recalled.

the recall is the result of several positive samples revealed during an fda. inspection. fda and cdc have informed us that these positive samples are linked to an outbreak of salmonella illness. the production area of our facility has been temporarily shut down until such time as the fda and the company determine that the problem has been corrected.

consumers who have purchased raw, fresh, unpackaged seafood are urged to return the product to the place of purchase for a full refund.

consumers with questions may call northeast seafood directly at 303-373-2226. monday to friday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. mountain time.

these items were shipped to institutions, restaurants, and retail locations in illinois, indiana, michigan, and wisconsin. consumers may have purchased the swai fillets in bulk or hand wrapped from the fish counter at retailers.

fsis is concerned that some product may be in institutional, restaurant, or consumers’ refrigerators or freezers. restaurants and institutions are urged not to serve these products. consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. these products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

fsis routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. when available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the fsis website at www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.
