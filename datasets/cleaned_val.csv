    food allergies consumers who have a food allergy or severe food sensitivity should always
    read ingredient labels. in restaurants, they should ask whether an allergy-causing
    ingredient is in the food. 
    a food allergy occurs when the immune
    system reacts to a certain food, usually within minutes after the food has been consumed. 
    symptoms may include throat swelling,
    trouble breathing, or a rash. 
    strictly avoiding the allergy-causing food
    is the only absolute way to avoid a reaction. 
    several foods account for 90% of allergic
    reactions. they include peanuts, tree nuts (walnuts, pecans, etc.), fish, shellfish, eggs,
    milk, soy, and wheat. 
    persons who have a severe, life-threatening
    food allergy should always carry, and know how to administer, prescription epinephrine."

 the product labels do not specifically state that egg white lysozyme, an allergen, is an ingredient.
                                  
 the following products are subject to recall: 
                                   24-ounce bags of bertolli, meatballs pomodoro & penne with peppers and onions in a tomato basil sauce, complete skillet meal for two. each label includes the establishment number, est. 21340 inside the usda mark of inspection. each label also includes one of the following best if used by dates: sep 14 06, dec 01 06, dec 16 06, dec 23 06, jan 04 07, feb 03 07 or feb 15 07. (

                                                                                               food allergies
                                              
                                               
consumers who have a food allergy, or severe food sensitivity, should always read ingredient labels. in restaurants, they should ask whether an allergy-causing ingredient is in the food.
                                              
a food allergy occurs when the immune system reacts to a certain food, usually within minutes after the food has been consumed.
                                              
symptoms may include throat swelling, breathing trouble or a rash.
                                              
strictly avoiding the allergy-causing food is the only absolute way to avoid a reaction.
                                              
several foods account for 90% of allergic reactions. they include peanuts, tree nuts (walnuts, pecans, etc.), fish, shellfish, eggs, milk, soy, and wheat.
                                              
persons who have a severe, life-threatening food allergy should always carry, and know how to administer, prescription epinephrine.
                                              
                                          
                                                                               
                                                                            
                                    
 the products were produced on various dates in september 2005, december 2005, january 2006 and february 2006 and sold to retail establishments nationwide.
                                  
 national custom packaging, inc., a castroville, calif., establishment (est. 21340) serves as the co-packer for unilever united states, inc.s bertolli brand products and packaged these products subject to recall.
                                  
 the problem was discovered by a supplier who then notified the company. fsis has had no reports of illness due to consumption of these products. anyone concerned about an allergic reaction should contact a physician.
                                  
 consumers with questions about the recall should call the bertolli toll-free recall hotline at (866) 837-7592. media with questions about the recall should call unilever united states, inc., associate manager of communications sabrina glavin at (877) 995-4483."

2009,1,30,us,2009 - meijer announces voluntary recall for some meijer brand peanuts and ice cream novelties citing possible health risk,"for immediate release -- grand rapids, mi – january 30, 2009, meijer initiated a voluntary recall of two types of its meijer brand dry-roasted peanuts and four types of meijer brand ice cream novelties sold in all of its stores in michigan, ohio, indiana, illinois and kentucky. meijer removed all identified products from its stores and gas stations. all sell-by dates are impacted by this recall.
specifically, meijer has recalled the following items:
meijer has taken these steps following announcements from the products' manufacturers that they may possibly be contaminated with salmonella. while none of the meijer brand products have been identified as contaminated or linked to any illness, meijer has received these products from nut bar company, inc. and fieldbrook foods, both of which used peanuts from peanut corporation of america in blakely, georgia, which has been verified as the source of contaminated peanut products.
salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. healthy persons infected with salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. in rare circumstances, infection with salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis. for more information on salmonella, please visit the centers for disease control and prevention's website at http://www.cdc.gov.
meijer requests that customers who have purchased these products destroy the product or return them to any meijer location for a full refund. if meijer customers are unsure if they have the recalled product, they are requested to bring in the product for determination or contact the meijer customer contact center at 800-543-3704. consumers with questions or concerns about their health should contact their health care provider. if symptoms are present, please visit a health care provider or go to a hospital emergency room.

2009,5,17,us,2009 - peanut corporation of america announces voluntary nationwide recall of peanut butter,"for immediate release -- lynchburg, va. (january 13, 2009) – peanut corporation of america (pca), a peanut processing company and maker of peanut butter for bulk distribution to institutions, food service industries, and private label food companies, today announced a voluntary recall of peanut butter produced in its blakely, georgia processing facility because it has the potential to be contaminated with salmonella.
all product affected was produced on or after july 1, 2008, specific to the lot numbers and descriptions listed below.
the peanut butter being recalled is sold by pca in bulk packaging to distributors for institutional and food service industry use. it is also sold under the brand name parnell’s pride to those same industries. additionally, it is sold by the king nut company under the label king nut. pca customers who received the recalled product are being notified by telephone and in writing.
none of the peanut butter being recalled is sold directly to consumers through retail stores.
“we deeply regret that this has happened,” said stewart parnell, owner and president of pca. “out of an abundance of caution, we are voluntarily withdrawing this product and contacting our customers. we are taking these actions with the safety of our consumers as our first priority.”
pca initiated this recall after an open container of king nut brand peanut butter in a long-term care facility in minnesota was found to contain a strain of salmonella. king nut brand peanut butter is produced by pca.
according to the minnesota department of health and minnesota department of agriculture, the minnesota laboratory analyses on the contamination in the already-opened container of peanut butter have the same genetic fingerprint as the cases in the national outbreak that has sickened almost 400 people in 42 states.
the voluntary recall of 21 lots of its peanut butter, in containers ranging from five to 50 pounds, is being taken immediately. pca is notifying its institutional customers and has set up a toll-free hotline number 1-877-564-7080 to answer questions.
pca is continuing to work closely and cooperating with the food and drug administration (fda) and centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), as well as state officials as part of this ongoing investigation.
according to a cdc update issued on their website today (january 13, 2009), preliminary analysis of an epidemiologic study conducted by cdc and public health officials has suggested peanut butter as a likely source. the cdc and other public health officials are continuing to conduct surveillance for cases of infection with the outbreak strains, and to gather and analyze data or exposures that may be associated with illness. to date, no association has been found with common brand names of peanut butter sold in grocery stores.
customers are asked to take all peanut butter manufactured with the lot numbers listed below out of distribution immediately. customers can call the following toll-free 24-hour number 1-877-564-7080 for further instructions on what to do with the product or visit the company website at www.peanutcorp.com for additional information.
eating food contaminated with salmonella can result in abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and fever. most people infected with salmonella develop the symptoms 12 to 72 hours after infection. the illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days, and most people recover without treatment. however, in some persons, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. in rare circumstances, infection with salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses. for more information on the salmonella bacteria, please visit the centers for disease control and prevention’s website at http://www.cdc.gov.

2010,1,15,us,new york firm recalls beef carcass that contains prohibited materials,"washington, january 15, 2010 - jerry hayes meats inc., a newark valley, n.y., establishment is recalling approximately 490 pounds of a beef carcass that may not have had the spinal column removed, which is not compliant with regulations that require the removal of spinal cord and vertebral column from cattle over 30 months of age, the u.s. department of agriculture's food safety and inspection service (fsis) announced today.
                                  
 spinal cord and vertebral column are considered a specified risk material (srm) and must be removed from cattle over 30 months of age in accordance with fsis regulations. srms are tissues that are known to contain the infective agent in cattle infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (bse), as well as materials that are closely associated with these potentially infective tissues. therefore, fsis prohibits srms from use as human food to minimize potential human exposure to the bse agent.
                                  
 the products subject to recall include: 
                                   1- ""beef carcass,"" which bears the establishment number ""est. 04488 m"" inside the usda mark of inspection.
                                  
 the product was packed on january 7, 2010, and sold to a single customer in new york.
                                  
 the problem was discovered through routine fsis inspection activities. fsis has received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of this product.
                                  
 fsis routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers (including restaurants) of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers.

wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot, soapy water. immediately clean spills.
                                              
keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry and egg products and cooked foods.
                                              
consumers should only eat ground beef or ground beef patties that have been cooked to a safe internal temperature of 160° f.
                                              
 color is not a reliable indicator that ground beef or ground beef patties have been cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria such as

 fsis advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° f. the only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.

2010,8,19,us,2010 - nucal foods conducts recall of shell eggs supplied from wright county egg because of possible health risk,"for immediate release - ripon, california - august 17, 2010 - the following statement was released by officials of nucal foods of ripon, california regarding the voluntary recall of shell eggs supplied from wright county egg of galt, iowa.
nucal foods is voluntarily recalling specific julian dates of shell eggs produced by wright county egg and packaged by nucal foods because they have the potential to be contaminated with salmonella. salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. healthy persons infected with salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. in rare circumstances, infection with salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections, endocarditis or arthritis.
eggs affected by this recall were distributed to food wholesalers and retailers in california and nevada. nucal foods received these eggs from wright county egg which were then packaged into 5-dozen overwrapped retail units. in addition to those products listed in the original wright county egg media statement dated august 13, 2010, the following products are being recalled:
 
dates and codes can be found printed on the overwrap film. the plant number begins with the letter p and then the number. the julian date follows the plant number, for example p-1686 142.
wright county egg’s media statement indicates that there have been confirmed salmonella enteritidis illnesses relating to shell eggs from wright county egg, and traceback investigations are ongoing.
consumers who believe they may have purchased these shell eggs should not eat them but should return them to the store where they were purchased for a full refund. this recall is of shell eggs only. consumers with questions should call 1-877-249-8224 or visit www.eggsafety.org.

wash hands before and after handling raw meat with warm/hot (preferred) or cold soapy running water by rubbing hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds. also wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot (preferred), soapy water and clean up any spills right away. the mechanical action of vigorous rubbing of hands and utensils/surfaces creates friction that helps to dislodge bacteria and viruses from hands and surfaces.
                                              
additionally, warm/hot water helps to dissolve fats/foods, aiding in cleaning/microbe removal and can also assist in deactivation of pathogens. for more information on hand washing, go to

 e. coli o157:h7 is a potentially deadly bacterium that can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration, and in the most severe cases, kidney failure. the very young, seniors and persons with weak immune systems are the most susceptible to foodborne illness.
                                  
 fsis advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° f. the only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.

wash hands before and after handling raw meat with warm/hot (preferred) or cold soapy running water by rubbing hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds. also wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot (preferred), soapy water and clean up any spills right away. the mechanical action of vigorous rubbing of hands and utensils/surfaces creates friction that helps to dislodge bacteria and viruses from hands and surfaces.

wash hands with warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds before and after handling raw meat and poultry. also wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot soapy water. clean up spills right away.
                                              
keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be cooked. use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry and egg products and cooked foods.
                                              
cook raw meat and poultry to safe internal temperatures before eating. the safe internal temperature for ground meat such as beef and pork is 160° f, and 165° f for poultry, as determined with a food thermometer.
                                              
refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase (one hour if temperatures exceed 90° f). refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking.

 fsis became aware of the problem during the course of an  
                                  ongoing investigation of a multi-state outbreak of  
                                  salmonella enteritidis involving 33 case-patients from 7 states (ma, me, nh, ny, ri, va, vt-preliminary data, subject to change). working in conjunction with the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), vermont department of health, new york state department of health, and new york state department of agriculture & markets, fsis was able to link illnesses in five case-patients to the ground beef products produced at this establishment based on epidemiologic and traceback investigations, as well as in-store reviews. illness onset dates among these five case-patients ranged from june 6, 2012 to june 13, 2012. two of the five case-patients were hospitalized. leftover product with no packaging information collected during the course of this investigation by the vermont department of health tested positive for  
                                  salmonella enteritidis with the outbreak strain. this outbreak strain of  
                                  salmonella enteritidis is drug sensitive, meaning antibiotics can be effective in treating patients who need them. fsis is continuing to work with cdc and public health partners on the investigation.
                                  
 consumption of food contaminated with  
                                  salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses.  
                                  salmonella infections can be life-threatening, especially to those with weak immune systems, such as infants, the elderly, and persons with hiv infection or those undergoing chemotherapy. the most common manifestations of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours. additional symptoms may be chills, headache, nausea and vomiting that can last up to seven days. individuals concerned about an illness should contact a health care provider.
                                  
 fsis advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume ground beef that has been cooked to a temperature of 160° f. the only way to confirm that ground beef is cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature.

2012,10,10,us,"2012 - dean foods company of california and meadow gold dairy conduct voluntary recall of two albertsons brand ice cream varieties - peanut butter cup and peanut butter chocolate in 1.5 quarts sizes - due to potential health risk posed by nationwide sunland, inc. peanut butter","for immediate release – october 10, 2012 – the dean foods company of california processing facility in buena park, calif., and meadow gold dairy processing facility in orem, utah, are taking the precautionary measure to voluntarily recall two ice cream varieties manufactured for albertsons supermarkets. this recall was initiated because the affected products contain a peanut butter ingredient supplied by sunland, inc. which may be contaminated with salmonella. the peanut butter manufacturer sunland recently expanded its nationwide product recall.
salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. healthy persons infected with salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. in rare circumstances, infection with salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
to date, no complaints or reactions have been reported related to these ice cream products, and only two flavors of albertsons ice cream are included in the recall. no meadow gold® brand ice cream products are included in this recall. both the “peanut butter cup” and “peanut butter chocolate” flavors are sold in 1.5 quarts (1.42l) cardboard cartons in albertsons stores. only the ice cream made in two plants is impacted by this recall and therefore the product being recalled was sold between 3/26/2010 and 9/25/2012 only in california, idaho, montana, nevada, north dakota, oregon, utah, wyoming and washington.
the ice cream is printed with one of two plant codes: either 49-11 or 06-20 and a “best by” or “exp” date ranging from 3/26/2011 to 9/25/2013.
no other albertsons or meadow gold brand ice cream products are affected by this recall. in particular, this recall only impacts albertsons ice cream products with the plant codes of 49-11 or 06-20 and sold in california, idaho, montana, nevada, north dakota, oregon, utah, wyoming and washington.
the processing facilities have ceased distribution of the affected product and recovery is actively underway. consumers who have this product should not consume it. they should discard it and may return the product package to the place of purchase for a full refund or exchange. consumers with questions can contact the company at 1-800-587-2259 between 8:00 am to 5:00 pm, central time, monday through friday, excluding holidays. 
the u.s. food and drug administration has been notified of this voluntary recall.

2013,7,16,us,2009 - peanut corporation of america provides additional information about expanded nationwide recall of peanut products,"for immediate release -- lynchburg, va. (february 8, 2009) -- in connection with the january 28, 2009 expanded recall announcement issued by peanut corporation of america (pca), the company wishes to highlight important information regarding several of its products.
on january 28, 2009, pca announced it was voluntarily recalling all peanuts and peanut products processed in its blakely, georgia facility since january 1, 2007 because they have the potential to be contaminated with salmonella.
salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. healthy persons infected with salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. in rare circumstances, infection with salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurisms), endocarditis and arthritis. for more information on salmonella, please visit the centers for disease control and prevention’s website at http://www.cdc.gov.
pca has not manufactured any products in cans and jars since 2007. however, because the january 28th recall notice indicated that pca does not sell products directly to consumers in stores, and because the expanded recall includes pca products made since the beginning of 2007, the potential for confusion may exist. therefore, the company is highlighting information about those former retail offerings to assist consumers who may have purchased those products and who may still have them in their possession. these products were part of the january 28th recall, but here, they are individually listed. consumers should be aware that the list below includes only pca's own brands that were sold to consumers at retail. the list does not include brands made by pca for other firms. fda continues to update its website to alert the public about any new recalls.
pca sold its casey’s, parnell’s pride, reggie, and robinson crusoe labels to 99 cent stuff, 99 cents only stores, dollar general, and dollar tree stores. below is a list of items and upc codes that were shipped to these discount retail chain stores and other customers that are affected by this recall:

2013,10,12,us,california wholesale store recalls rotisserie chicken products due to possible salmonella heidelberg contamination,"washington, oct. 12, 2013 – costco’s el camino real store in south san francisco, calif., is recalling 9,043 units (approximately 39,755 lbs.) of rotisserie chicken products that may be contaminated with a strain of salmonella heidelberg, the u.s. department of agriculture’s food safety and inspection service (fsis) announced today.

the products subject to recall are:

8,730 “kirkland signature foster farms” rotisserie chickens

313 total units of “kirkland farm” rotisserie chicken soup, rotisserie chicken leg quarters, and rotisserie chicken salad
the products were sold directly to consumers in a costco located at 1600 el camino real, south san francisco, calif., between sept. 11 and sep. 23, 2013.

this recall was initiated due to concerns about a group of salmonella heidelberg illnesses that may be associated with the consumption of rotisserie chicken products prepared in and purchased at the costco el camino real store. the pfge pattern (0258) associated with this outbreak is reported rarely in the united states. fsis, working with the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), the california department of public health and the county of san mateo public health department, determined through epidemiologic and traceback investigations that there is a link between the costco el camino real rotisserie chicken products and this illness outbreak. fsis is continuing to work with cdc, public health partners in california and costco on the investigation. fsis will continue to provide information as it becomes available.

this group of illnesses is part of a larger cluster of salmonella heidelberg illnesses that are known to be multi-drug resistant. for more information about the larger cluster, visit: http://www.cdc.gov/salmonella/heidelberg-10-13/index.html.

fsis routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. costco has already taken steps to contact every customer who purchased rotisserie chicken products. when available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the fsis website at: http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/recalls-and-public-health-alerts/current-recalls-and-alerts.

consumers and media with questions regarding the recall should contact costco at (800) 774-2678.

fsis reminds consumers to properly handle raw poultry in a manner to prevent contamination from spreading to other foods and food contact surfaces.

fsis further reminds consumers of the critical importance of following package cooking instructions for frozen or fresh chicken products and general food safety guidelines when handling and preparing any raw meat or poultry. in particular, while cooking instructions may give a specific number of minutes of cooking for each side of the product in order to attain 165 °f internal temperature, consumers should be aware that actual time may vary depending on the cooking method (broiling, frying, or grilling) and the temperature of the product (chilled versus frozen) so it is important that the final temperature of 165 °f must be reached for safety. please do not rely on the cooking time for each side of the product, but use a food thermometer.

all poultry products should be cooked to a safe minimum internal temperature of 165° f as determined by a food thermometer. using a food thermometer is the only way to know that food has reached a high enough temperature to destroy foodborne bacteria.

consumption of food contaminated with salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. salmonella infections can be life-threatening, especially to those with weak immune systems, such as infants, the elderly, and persons with hiv or undergoing chemotherapy. the most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever within eight to 72 hours. additional symptoms may be chills, headache, nausea and vomiting that can last up to seven days.

consumers with food safety questions can ""ask karen,"" the fsis virtual representative available 24 hours a day at askkaren.gov. the toll-free usda meat and poultry hotline 1-888-mphotline (1-888-674-6854) is available in english and spanish and can be reached from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. (eastern time) monday through friday. recorded food safety messages are available 24 hours a day.

#


recommendations for preventing salmonellosis:

wash hands before and after handling raw meat and poultry with warm/hot (preferred) or cold soapy running water by rubbing hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds. also wash cutting boards, dishes and utensils with hot (preferred), soapy water and clean up any spills right away. the mechanical action of vigorous rubbing of hands and utensils/surfaces creates friction that helps to dislodge bacteria and viruses from hands and surfaces.

additionally, warm/hot water helps to dissolve fats/foods, aiding in cleaning/microbe removal and can also assist in deactivation of pathogens. for more information on hand washing, go to http://www.cdc.gov/handwashing.

if soapy water is not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. alcohol-based hand sanitizers can reduce the number of germs on hands in some situations. however, sanitizers do not eliminate all types of germs, including viruses.

keep raw meat, fish and poultry away from other food that will not be thoroughly cooked. use separate cutting boards for raw meat, poultry, and their juices and thoroughly cooked foods. thoroughly cook raw meat and poultry to safe internal temperatures (160º f for ground meat such as beef and pork and 165º f for all poultry, as measured with a food thermometer) before eating. refrigerate raw meat and poultry within two hours after purchase (one hour if temperatures exceed 90º f). refrigerate cooked meat and poultry within two hours after cooking."

each package bears the establishment number “est. 11041” inside the usda mark of inspection. the products were sold at the wholesale and retail level in arizona, california, oklahoma, nevada, texas and by phone orders.

the problem was discovered by fsis personnel during a food safety assessment. the inspector was reviewing processing records and found that the water level in the product may have been high enough to allow for the production of staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin. fsis has received no reports of illnesses associated with consumption of these products. individuals concerned about an illness should contact a physician.

2014,3,7,us,arkansas firm recalls chicken products due to misbranding and undeclared allergen,"washington, march 7, 2014 – george’s inc., a springdale, ark. establishment, is recalling approximately 29,200 pounds of seasoned raw, chicken breast strips due to misbranding and an undeclared allergen, the u.s. department of agriculture’s food safety and inspection service (fsis) announced today. the products are formulated with soy protein, a known allergen, and monosodium glutamate (msg). however, the product was released with a label for george’s boneless skinless breast pieces with rib meat, which does not declare soy or msg on the label.

the products subject to recall bear the label:

40 lb. bulk cartons of “george’s boneless skinless breast pieces w/rib meat” with case code 4790.
the products were produced and packaged from dec. 21 through dec. 23, 2013, and were sold to distributors in tennessee and iowa for further distribution. the recalled products bear the establishment number “p-13584” below the usda mark of inspection and “packed on” date in the format of “mm/dd/yy” on the carton label.

the problem was discovered after the company received a customer complaint of incorrectly labeled product. the customer noticed that the product they received appeared to be seasoned, when it was labeled as being simply boneless, skinless breast pieces. the company’s investigation found that the mislabeling occurred when the george’s label was mistakenly applied to allergen containing products packaged nearby. fsis and the company have received no reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. anyone concerned about a reaction should contact a healthcare provider.

2015,3,7,us,rio tex wholesale meats recalls ready-to-eat beef products due to possible listeria contamination,"washington, march 6, 2015 – rio tex wholesale meats, a mercedes, texas establishment, is recalling approximately 58,180 pounds of ready-to-eat beef products that may be contaminated with listeria monocytogenes (lm), the u.s. department of agriculture’s food safety and inspection service (fsis) announced today.

the beef products were produced on various dates between march 25, 2014 and february 19, 2015. the following products are subject to recall: [view labels (pdf only)]

20-lb. boxes containing four 5-lb. packages of “hausman foods cooked beef taco filling.”

20-lb. boxes containing four 5-lb. packages of “hausman foods seasoned cooked beef barbacoa.”

20-lb. boxes containing four 5-lb. packages of “hausman foods fully cooked barbacoa.”

20-lb. boxes containing four 5-lb. packages of “hausman foods beef carne guisada.”

15-lb. and 45-lb. boxes containing three 5-lb. or 15-lb. packages of “rio-tex-meats barbacoa.”
the products subject to recall bear the establishment number “est. 13545” inside the usda mark of inspection. these products were shipped for hotels, restaurants and institutional use in texas.

the problem was discovered when fsis personnel reviewed historical sampling data in the context of recent intensified verification testing with multiple listeria monocytogenes positives. the historical sampling showed a recurrence of lm isolates with indistinguishable pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) patterns over a period of time within the establishment. the presence of isolates with indistinguishable pfge patterns in environmental samples (including food contact and non-food contact surfaces) and on ready-to-eat meat products indicates that there are insufficient sanitary measures to prevent contamination of the production environment and the products with lm.

consumption of food contaminated with l. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. an invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. in pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. in addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

fsis and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

fsis routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. when available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the fsis website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

fsis advises all consumers to reheat ready-to-eat product until steaming hot.

the whole hogs for barbeque item were produced on various dates between april 18, 2015 and july 27, 2015. the following products are subject to recall:

varying weights of whole hogs for barbeque
the product subject to recall bears the establishment number “est. 1628” inside the usda mark of inspection. the product was shipped to various individuals, retail locations, institutions, and distributors in alaska and washington.

on july 15, 2015, the washington state department of health notified fsis of an investigation of salmonella i4,[5],12:i:-illnesses. working in conjunction with the washington state department of health and the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), fsis determined that there is a link between whole hogs for barbeque from kapowsin meats and these illnesses. traceback investigation has identified 32 case-patients who consumed whole hogs for barbeque from this establishment prior to illness onset. these illnesses are part of a larger illness investigation. based on epidemiological evidence, 134 case-patients have been identified in washington with illness onset dates ranging from april 25, 2015 to july 29, 2015. fsis continues to work with our public health partners on this ongoing investigation.

consumption of food contaminated with salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. the most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. the illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. most people recover without treatment. in some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

fsis and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

fsis routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. when available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the fsis website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

fsis advises all consumers to safely prepare their raw meat products, including fresh and frozen, and only consume pork and whole hogs for barbeque that have been cooked to a minimum internal temperature of 145° f with a three minute rest time. the only way to confirm that whole hogs for barbeque are cooked to a temperature high enough to kill harmful bacteria is to use a food thermometer that measures internal temperature, http://1.usa.gov/1cdxcdq. for whole hogs for barbeque make sure to check the internal temperature with a food thermometer in several places. check the temperature frequently and replenish wood or coals to make sure the fire stays hot. remove only enough meat from the carcass as you can serve within 1-2 hours.

media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact john anderson, owner, at (253) 847-1777.

the products were distributed to food service and retail stores throughout iowa, illinois, indiana, kentucky, michigan, minnesota, missouri, nebraska, nevada, ohio, pennsylvania, tennessee, wisconsin and west virginia.
products were distributed under the following brand names: blue goose market, hollywood market, market fresh fine foods, roger's foodland, marv & alison's marketplace, long lake market, martin's, holiday market, the purple onion, trentwood farms, angeli foods, market square, village food market, martha's vineyard, remke market or as generic product without branding.
the affected products can be identified by:
there are no reported illnesses in connection with these products to date.
this was brought to our attention by our supplier, international foodsource, llc who recalled raw pistachios after testing performed by an fda contract testing laboratory revealed the presence of salmonella. as a precaution, lipari foods products are being recalled as they have the potential to be contaminated due to the fact that they were packed from an affected lot that was received from international foodsource, llc. we are working closely with international foodsource, llc and the fda to understand the cause of the situation and ensure that all affected product has been pulled from commerce.
consumers who have purchased this recalled product should not consume it. they should return it to the point of purchase.

many clinical laboratories do not test for non-o157 shiga toxin-producing e. coli (stec), such as stec o121 because it is harder to identify than stec o157. people can become ill from stecs 2–8 days (average of 3–4 days) after consuming the organism. most people infected with stec o121 develop diarrhea (often bloody), and vomiting. some illnesses last longer and can be more severe. infection is usually diagnosed by testing of a stool sample. vigorous rehydration and other supportive care is the usual treatment; antibiotic treatment is generally not recommended.

most people recover within a week, but, rarely, some develop a more severe infection. hemolytic uremic syndrome (hus) is uncommon with stec o121 infection. hus can occur in people of any age but is most common in children under 5 years old, older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. it is marked by easy bruising, pallor, and decreased urine output. persons who experience these symptoms should seek emergency medical care immediately.

fsis and the company are concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers' freezers.

this voluntary recall is the result of testing by a fda-contracted laboratory which revealed that a 4oz package of diamond of california® chopped macadamia nuts contained salmonella.
this voluntary recall covers only the following products:
the voluntary recall is limited to multiple production codes of the two products listed below. to locate the production code on the package, consumers should look on the front of the package. no other production codes, sizes or varieties of diamond of california® products are affected by this recall.

2016,11,19,us,sabra dipping company issues voluntary recall of certain hummus products because of possible health risks,"updated on november 23, 2016 with new information identified by asterick(*).
colonial heights, va - sabra dipping co., llc is voluntarily recalling certain hummus products made prior to november 8, 2016 due to concerns over listeria monocytogenes, which was identified at the manufacturing facility but not in tested finished product. the recall includes the products listed below; these were distributed to retail outlets, including food service accounts and supermarkets, in the u.s. and canada.
listeria monocytogenes is an organism, which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headaches, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea.  listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.  the company is issuing this recall out of an abundance of caution.
consumers with any product with a “best before” date up through january 23, 2017 are urged to discard it. consumers can find code and “best before” date on the lid of each package.
* the sabra party platter selects contains sealed and capped containers of sabra classic hummus 7oz; cheese and genoa salame sliced at daniele international, inc; and pre-packaged breadsticks. the genoa salame is a usda regulated product; the party tray includes the usda mark of inspection next to the salami packaged in the tray and “est. 9992” next to the pre-packaged breadsticks in the tray. these party trays are subject to recall; the entire contents of the party tray should not be consumed due to the potential for cross contamination of other tray components with the recalled hummus through consumer handling.
no other sabra products are affected. in particular, sabra products not included in the recall are: sabra organic hummus, sabra salsa, sabra guacamole and sabra greek yogurt dips.
consumers can contact sabra consumer relations at 1-866-265-6761 for additional information from 9:00 am to 8:00 pm eastern time. for product reimbursement, consumers can contact www.sabrahummusrecall.com. full list of impacted product is below. the company has subsequently taken steps to correct this matter.

2017,1,10,us,palmer candy company announces voluntary limited recall of select candy products,"palmer candy company (www.palmercandy.com), a privately-held, fifth-generation manufacturer of chocolate and holiday confections, announced today a limited recall of certain chocolate products after being informed by a supplier that a milk powder ingredient used in a compound chocolate coating that they supply to palmer candy company has the potential to be contaminated with salmonella. the voluntary recall, in cooperation with the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) includes selected products produced between october 20, 2016 and december 9, 2016 and shipped by palmer candy company to grocery, convenience store and wholesale customers nationwide. 
recalled products include the following:
upc #s are usually on the back of the bag or bottom of containers. product photos are attached.
to date, there have been no reported illnesses associated with any of the products affected by this recall. salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. healthy persons infected with salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. in rare circumstances, infection with salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
the recall is the result of a potentially contaminated milk powder ingredient recalled by valley milk products, a derivative of which was included as a small portion of the ingredients by another company in a confectionary coating supplied to palmer candy company. affected products include a variety of candy products sold to retailers under the palmer candy company brand, private label chocolates for retail distribution and bulk products provided to retailers for repackaging. although testing has shown no pathogenic bacteria in the milk confectionary coatings, the company decided out of an abundance of caution to recall all products produced using any amount of the now recalled ingredients.
marty palmer, president and chief executive officer of palmer candy company said, “we are truly sorry for any distress this recall causes to our retail customers and to consumers. we remain committed to the highest standards in food quality and safety. we are taking this recall very seriously and truly appreciate the cooperation of our customers as we work to resolve this matter promptly.”
consumers should throw out or return these products to the point of sale for a full refund. for more information, consumers may call to speak with a customer service representative at palmer candy company between 9:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. central standard time at 712-258-5543.
the palmer candy company, founded in 1878, is a leading manufacturer of a wide variety of high quality chocolate and specialty confectionary treats. the company ships from its two facilities in sioux city, iowa to grocery, convenience store and wholesale customers nationwide. the company president and chief executive officer, marty palmer, is a fifth-generation owner of the privately-held company.

salmonella is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. healthy persons infected with salmonella often experience fever, diarrhea (which may be bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. in rare circumstances, infection with salmonella can result in the organism getting into the bloodstream and producing more severe illnesses such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis.
the products included in the recall can be identified by the following lot numbers, which can be found printed along the top of the bag. images of the bags can be found below.
ampi dry whey powder is not sold directly to consumers, but is used as an ingredient in a number of foods. it is sold directly to manufacturers and also distributed by brokers. a limited amount was sold for animal feed. all products shipped into the marketplace tested negative for salmonella as part of ampi’s routine testing program. however, because additional product tested positive for salmonella under ampi’s routine test and hold procedures, the company is recalling product as a precautionary measure. ampi has ceased production at its blair, wis., dry whey plant, is currently investigating the cause for the positive samples, and will take all necessary remedial actions.
all customers that have received the dry whey powder lots have been notified by ampi and instructed to return the recalled powder, or to document the destruction of the powder, after contacting ampi for specific instructions.

fsis and public health partners, including the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), the wisconsin department of health services and wisconsin department of agriculture, trade and consumer protection, have been investigating a multistate outbreak of salmonella schwarzengrund illnesses involving 5 case patients from 2 states. wisconsin collected three intact butterball brand ground turkey samples from a residence where 4 of the case patients live. the case patients and ground turkey salmonella schwarzengrund isolates are closely related, genetically.

consumption of food contaminated with salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. the most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 12 to 72 hours after eating the contaminated product. the illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. most people recover without treatment. in some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

fsis is concerned that some product may be frozen and in consumers’ freezers. consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. these products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

listeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.
the recalled products – california-grown conventional and organic avocados -- were packed at henry avocado’s packing facility in california and distributed in arizona, california, florida new hampshire, north carolina and wisconsin. all shipments from the packing facility are subject to the recall (henry avocado did not begin packing there until late january 2019). avocados imported from mexico and distributed by henry avocado are not subject to the recall and may continue to be sold and consumed.
henry avocado is contacting all affected customers to confirm that the recalled products are immediately removed from store shelves. for conventional products purchased at retail, consumers can identify the recalled products by the “bravocado” stickers. henry avocado organic products do not carry the “bravocado” label on the sticker. instead those products are labeled “organic” and include “california” on the sticker. retailers can identify henry avocado organic products by the bar code on the stickers.
consumers who have purchased any recalled avocados are urged not to consume them, but to discard them or return them to the place of purchase for a full refund. consumers with further questions may contact henry avocado at (760) 745-6632, ext 132 or visit www.henryavocado.com/media
henry avocado corporation is fully cooperating with federal and california health officials to facilitate an efficient and complete recall of these avocados.
“we are voluntarily recalling our products and taking every action possible to ensure the safety of consumers who eat our avocados,” says phil henry, president of henry avocado.

2019,11,10,us,ezzo sausage company recalls meat products due to possible listeria contamination,"washington, nov. 9, 2019 – ezzo sausage company, a columbus, ohio establishment, is recalling approximately 25,115 pounds of sausage products that may be adulterated with listeria monocytogenes, the u.s. department of agriculture’s food safety and inspection service (fsis) announced today.

the ready-to-eat sausage products were produced on oct. 29, 2019, oct. 30, 2019 and nov. 5, 2019. this spreadsheet contains a list of the products subject to the recall. [view labels(pdf only) 

the products subject to recall bear establishment number “est. 1838a” inside the usda mark of inspection. these items were shipped to distribution centers in indiana and ohio.

the problem was discovered when the firm notified fsis of a positive sample result for listeria monocytogenes.

there have been no confirmed reports of adverse reactions due to consumption of these products. anyone concerned about an injury or illness should contact a healthcare provider.

consumption of food contaminated with l. monocytogenes can cause listeriosis, a serious infection that primarily affects older adults, persons with weakened immune systems, and pregnant women and their newborns. less commonly, persons outside these risk groups are affected.

listeriosis can cause fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. an invasive infection spreads beyond the gastrointestinal tract. in pregnant women, the infection can cause miscarriages, stillbirths, premature delivery or life-threatening infection of the newborn. in addition, serious and sometimes fatal infections in older adults and persons with weakened immune systems. listeriosis is treated with antibiotics. persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell the health care provider about eating the contaminated food.

fsis is concerned that some product may be in distribution centers, restaurants, or institutional refrigerators or freezers. restaurants and institutions that have purchased these products are urged not to serve them. these products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

fsis routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. when available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the fsis website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.

media and consumers with questions regarding the recall can contact darryl thompson, v.p business development, ezzo sausage company, at (614) 445-8841.

consumers with food safety questions can call the toll-free usda meat and poultry hotline at 1-888-mphotline (1-888-674-6854) or live chat via ask usda from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (eastern time) monday through friday. consumers can also browse food safety messages at ask usda or send a question via email to mphotline@usda.gov. for consumers that need to report a problem with a meat, poultry, or egg product, the online electronic consumer complaint monitoring system can be accessed 24 hours a day at https://foodcomplaint.fsis.usda.gov/eccf/."

  fsis announcement
  
  
  
            washington, aug. 27, 2021 – fratelli beretta usa, inc., a mount olive, n.j. establishment, is recalling approximately 862,000 pounds of uncured antipasto products that may be contaminated with salmonella infantis and/or salmonella typhimurium, the u.s. department of agriculture’s food safety and inspection service (fsis) announced today.

the ready-to-eat (rte) uncured antipasto meat trays were produced on february 28, 2021 through august 15, 2021. the following products are subject to recall [view labels]: 

24-oz. trays containing two 12-oz packages of “fratelli beretta uncured antipasto prosciutto, soppressata, milano salami & coppa” with best by dates of aug 27 21 through feb 11 22 and upc code 073541305316.
the products subject to recall bear establishment number “est. 7543b” printed on the packaging next to the best by date. these items were shipped to retail locations nationwide.             

fsis has been working with the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) and public health partners to investigate a multistate outbreak of 36 salmonella typhimurium and infantis illnesses in 17 states, with onset dates ranging from may 9 through july 27, 2021. some ill people reported eating fratelli beretta brand uncured antipasto before they got sick and the traceback investigation confirmed that some of the ill people purchased uncured antipasto trays produced by fratelli beretta usa, inc. fsis continues to work with the cdc and state and local public health partners on this investigation to determine if additional products are linked to illness. fsis will provide updated information if it becomes available.

consumption of food contaminated with salmonella can cause salmonellosis, one of the most common bacterial foodborne illnesses. the most common symptoms of salmonellosis are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever within 6 hours to 6 days after eating the contaminated product. the illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. most people recover without treatment. in some persons, however, the diarrhea may be so severe that the patient needs to be hospitalized. older adults, infants, and persons with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop a severe illness. individuals concerned about an illness should contact their health care provider.

fsis is concerned that some product is in consumers’ refrigerators. consumers who have purchased these products are urged not to consume them. these products should be thrown away or returned to the place of purchase.

fsis routinely conducts recall effectiveness checks to verify recalling firms notify their customers of the recall and that steps are taken to make certain that the product is no longer available to consumers. when available, the retail distribution list(s) will be posted on the fsis website atwww.fsis.usda.gov/recalls.
